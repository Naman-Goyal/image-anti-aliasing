## Project Idea: 
Build a library for Python that supports the up-scaling of images.

## Motivation:
As monitor resolutions grow higher, the need for a versatile image scaling library grows greater.
In some cases, there is a need for a high-quality anti-aliasing, and in other cases, there is a need for a high-speed one.
In the early stages, the algorithms will be limited, but the goal of this project is to provide a sizable library that is versatile and streamlined.
